Logs out users within defined time when inactive. Modify to show only wake up message and not log out as well. Supported for multisites as well.

== Description ==

Make your WP account secure from snoopers, friends to protect your data by assuring auto log out system within a certain defined time. This will help you keep safe from any users using same machine to access your account in case you are away and forgot to logout and kept your site logged open. 

Simple but works efficiently. Nothing much to explain on plugin use. As its simple to use. You can find inactive settings under settings menu in admin dashboard.

**Some Feature Highlights**.

1. Change idle timeout time.
2. Count down of 10 seconds before actual logout. You can remove this feature if you dont want it.
3. Add only **Wake Up!** message where user will not logout but instead a wakeup message will be shown upon inactive.
4. Custom Popup Message.
5. Choose to use concurrent logout functionality derived from [prevent concurrent logins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/prevent-concurrent-logins/ "Prevent Concurrent Logins") by Frankie Jarrett. Thumbs up here too !

In order to style dialog boxes you can use css classes. Also, works in **frontend view as well**.
