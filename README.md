Protect your WordPress users’ sessions from shoulder surfers and snoopers!

Use the Inactive Logout plugin to automatically terminate idle user sessions, thus protecting the site if the users leave unattended sessions.

The plugin is very easy to configure and use. Once you install and activate the plugin simply configure the idle timeout from the plugin settings. So now any unattended idle WordPress user sessions will be terminated automatically. You can also display a custom message to idle user sessions, alerting them that the session is about to end.
